# Todo List App
This miniature application was written alongside Colt Steele's [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp).

Live Sample: [Todo List App on GH Pages](https://git.io/vb0iy)

## Differences
I opted to change the creation towards my own preferences, featuring **ES6 (ES2015)** over outdated JavaScript, implementing the use of **Webpack and babel**, constructing the style with **Sass**, and **modularizing the scripts, as well as the styles**. I also deconstructed a few of Colt's functions in my object's methods so I could segregate each feature.

## Notes
Todo List App was built as a learning project. Due to the differences in my code, I've opted to leave the repo online as a source for anyone looking to follow Colt's tutorials with an updated touch.

This project will remain archived as a resource for other developers.
