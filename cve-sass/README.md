# Clear View Escapes: Sass Edition

### About
------
Clear View Escapes is a travel site created alongside Brad Schiff's [Git a Web Developer Job: Mastering the Modern Workflow](https://www.udemy.com/git-a-web-developer-job-mastering-the-modern-workflow).

**This version of Clear View Escapes was written in Sass!**

### Notes

Git a Web Developer Job was an excellent learning experience that helped me think a lot about development in terms of working in steps. Brad helps students tighten their understanding of Git and Gulp, as well as solidifying the concepts of the BEM naming convention, and coding with a "mobile first" state of mind. The code in this repository is different than Brad's project, featuring Sass rather than vanilla CSS, but the end result was ultimately the same.
