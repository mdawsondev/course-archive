# Clear View Escapes
Clear View Escapes is a travel site created alongside Brad Schiff's [Git a Web Developer Job: Mastering the Modern Workflow](https://www.udemy.com/git-a-web-developer-job-mastering-the-modern-workflow). Wow, what a mouthful! My [Certificate of Completion](ude.my/UC-LY9DH0YE) is available through Udemy.

This course tought me a lot about development in terms of working through steps. I feel that Brad helped me tighten my fundamental understanding of Git and Gulp, as well as solidifying the concept of the BEM naming convention and coding with a "mobile first" state of mind.

Brad elected to use postcss in his gulp workflow, leading him to write in CSS. I elected to instead use Sass! As such, my code repository is different than his, but the end result is ultimately the same.
