# Todo List App

This mini-app was written along side Colt Steele's [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp)! I opted to change the creation towards my own preferences, featuring ES6 over outdated JavaScript, implementing the use of Webpack and babel, constructing the style with Sass, and modularizing the scripts, as well as the styles. I also deconstructed a few of Colt's functions in my object's methods so I could segregate each feature.

The app is currently unbuilt for GitHub docs, but will be revisited and expanded in the future.
