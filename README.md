# Course Archive

This repository includes various completed projects that were coded beside courses via Udemy, Pluralsight, etc., and I don't intend to work on beyond the base lesson. Some of them include variations in code (Sass instead of CSS, various bug-fixes) but overall they're generally the same as the course.

Feel free to use them however you like!
