# Synthatap
Synthatap is an infant version of a [Patatap](https://patatap.com/) clone! Well, sort of. It was created as part of The Web Developer's Bootcamp course, but will remain as a playground for me to experiment with [Paper.js](https://paperjs.org) and [Howler.js](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js)

Push keys, hear noises, see shapes.

## Features
At the moment, Synthatap's features are negligible; keys are mapped to generic noises and simple visuals.

## Notes
I really enjoyed working with the Paper.js library, and fully intend to explore the project more down the line. That said, there's not a lot to Synthatap at the moment, so if you're lurking in this repo you're probably very bored or very lost.
