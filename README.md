# Todo List App

This mini-app was written along side Colt Steele's The Web Developer's Bootcamp! I opted to change the creation towards my own preferences, featuring ES6 over outdated JavaScript, implementing the use of Webpack and babel, constructing the style with SASS, and modularizing the scripts and styles. I also deconstructed a few of Colt's functions in my object's methods so I could segregate each feature.
